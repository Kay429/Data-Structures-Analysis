# Data-Structures-Analysis

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

* ABC University wanted a program that could search through and print information about their computer science courses. I created pseudocode for three possible data structures that could hold these data: a vector, a hash table, and a binary search tree. For the projects, I needed to analyze each data structure and determine which would be best suited to the university's needs, then create a program to implement my chosen data structure.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

* I did a runtime analysis of each data structure and considered which would be a best fit for the data. I bounced back and forth for awhile, but settled on using a vector because the data set was so small and likely would never get big enough that searching for a course becomes slow. I wanted to do a binary search tree at first because they are usually the fastest to search, but realized that it is not necessarily the best option.This is why it is important to understand data structures. Speed, space, and other factors need to be taken into consideration when selecting one. The more you know about a data structure, the more educated your decisions will be.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

 * I ran into a variety of roadblocks during this course. There were technical issues in the beginning that got in the way of completing my work. There were sometimes errors in my code that took hours to figure out. I dealt with it by taking breaks when I needed them, and being willing to put work off until later. When I am programming and run into an error, it is really hard to walk away from, but a fresh perspective always makes problem solving a lot easier.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

* I have learned a lot about determining runtime analysis and creating data structures. It really wasn't until the final projects that some of these concepts actually clicked with me. Big O notation was particularly intimidating, and even in my notes in project one it can be seen that I was not quite sure what I was doing at first. I certainly need more practice to become comfortable with these, but I think I've got a good start. Even as I was writing my code, I came up with new ways to execute my ideas and compared their worst case runtime to one another in order to determine the most effective strategy.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

* I tried to consider how the program could be expanded upon while deciding on a data structure. I thought about how many courses would be in a document if ABCU wanted to add to what they already had. This was assuming that different programs would have their own seperate files, but still I tried to be as flexible as possible with my program. I also tried to be as clear with my comments as possible without commenting too much. Overall I think my program is one of the easiest to read and modify that I have done.
